This is a test handwritten document. It contains text in English and Russian with some French and German names. It also contains lists, poems, starred paragraphs, headers, ==highlights.==

☆ From Fassbinder's interview with Hans Günther Pflaum — "I make films out of personal involvement, and for no other reason"

— I recall from earlier conversations that for a long time now you've consciously made a distinction between movies and television and see the two tasks facing you as quite different.

— That's right. I've always said you have a different kind of responsibility. With a movie I would argue much more for shock effects, because I agree with Kracauer when he says that when the lights go out in the movie theater it's as if a dream were beginning: in other words, that ==a movie works through the subconscious==. The movie version I've written is [...] not only not nearly so epic in style, but also not nearly so positive in its portrayal of Franz Biberkopf; rather it underscores the contradictions and the craziness of the character more than the TV version.

**This is by Kobayashi Issa:**

==Дятел
Стучать перестал. Прислушивается.== 
Вечерний гонг.

Скачи, блоха!
Ведь тебе все равно куда — 
Так лучше к лотосам.

☆ Лепешки
Переваривая, займусь заодно
Прививкой деревьев.

**From Diary of a Film by Jean Cocteau:**

☆ The older we get with age, the more our work must get beautiful and reflect a childlike version of ourselves.

Finally, let's try something difficult:

| English | Russian |
|---|---|
| Tatyana | Татьяна |
| Tottenham Hotspurs | Тоттенхэм Хотспур |
| Karl Marx | Карл Маркс |

This concludes the initial version of the text document.
